# About

The Stanford Technology Analytics and Genomics in Sleep (STAGES) study is a prospective cross-sectional, multi-site study involving 20 data collection sites from six centers including Stanford University, Bogan Sleep Consulting, Geisinger Health, Mayo Clinic, MedSleep, and St. Luke's Hospital. The project has collected data on 1,500 adult/adolescent patients evaluated for sleep disorders, including:

- Objective nocturnal sleep polysomnography (PSG) recordings (EEGs, chin and leg EMGs, nasal and oral breathing, chest movements, leg movements, position, EKG). This is the gold standard for sleep evaluation in sleep clinics.
- Comprehensive subjective sleep symptoms assessment through an on-line sleep questionnaire called the Alliance Sleep Questionnaire (ASQ, developed over 5 years by 5 academic institutions). The questionnaire also includes key medical history questions.
- Continuous actigraphy over several weeks to get untransformed activity counts (a Huami/Xiaomi actigraph device has been identified and validated against PSG and clinical gold standard Actiwatch)
- 3-D facial scans to extract craniofacial features predictive of sleep apnea
- On-line neuropsychological assessments and psychovigilance tests (impact of sleep disorders)
- Medical record data

All data, samples, analytic tools, and supporting documentation will be made publicly available for use by any interested researcher, provided a request is submitted to the National Sleep Research Resource and approved.
